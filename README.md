Word Guess Game


Read a word from an array of possible guesses. the array is called game.

the randomly selected word will dispalay on the screen using _ _ _ _ _

when a win happens, an audio sound will be played


What is not working in this game:
if a letter has been guessedm it should not count against the number of guesses remaining.

I was unable to read the array that contains the already guessed letters.
